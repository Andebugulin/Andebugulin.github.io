  title={Today, is a great weather, unfortunatelly, I watched a movie yesterday and forgot to do my journal, but doesn't matter. I feel purposeless, yeap, I guess the right word for that would be depression, i don't have friends rn, nor i do have a job, nor i do have a partner. I guess I have to change, i gotta schedule my life. Gotta find purpose! Today the music of the day is Bye Bye Baby by Requin Chagrin :) merci beacoup},

  title={Today was a good day, I helped my friend Фемистокл with a job, and got my first salary man, I feel great, first salary I gave to my mother :) She was blushing for sure ))) I met my another friend Саша, got my new glasses, thank you so much!! Drinking kefir right now, I wanna change my life even bigger, i guess now I feel it, I got passion in life, that's unprecedentedly big feeling when you finally figure out something that was upon you for a while. Like a rock that finally hits the water and makes the splash, constant relief with realization that you finally made a plan, a foundation for your goals and future, when you are not wasted around time like you were, when you believe in yourself inarguably, with no doubt, but with analization, I wish you all a great day, today was a great day for me!},

  title={Today was strange, first of all, I failed nofap, very disappointed I was, but made 15 day strike, and intend to not lose from now on, if I lose I pay to my friend 100$, so, it is now concrete. Skated and made beautiful progress, new skate shoes are very good, I enjoed them a lot, played basketball as well, my handle is better now I can feel it, but I am on my grind, want to eliminate not needed pleasure and get what I want. Today the kid told me that I have nice shoes, it was very nice, cool kid. Today music of the day is (I deleted music because I think I spend too much listening music, right now listening game of thrones tho, enjoy it a lot)},

A passionate software developer and student at XAMK, Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

I'm learning computer science, low level programming and linux, love the open-source and great music.

```arduino
$ vim interests
```

Youâ€™ll find me living, doing bunch of sports, just enjoying life. I run <span style="color: #CBC3E3;">Arch Linux</span>  on a <span style="color: #CBC3E3;"> Hyprland</span> desktop, I enjoy the concept of customization, and availability, I like music a lot and all kinds of sports.

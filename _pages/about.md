```arduino
$ whoami
```
A passionate software developer and student at XAMK, Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

I'm on a journey of exploration in web development and low-level programming, with a special love for the open-source community and great music.

```arduino
$ nvim interests
```
Outside the box, youâ€™ll find me living an active lifestyle, just chilling with friends or reading books. I run linux <span style="color: #CBC3E3;">Arch btw</span>  on a <span style="color: #CBC3E3;">fancy Hyprland</span> desktop, I enjoy the concept of efficiency, customization, and availability.

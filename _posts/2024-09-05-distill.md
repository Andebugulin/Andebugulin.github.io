## Introduction

In this report, I will try to delve into the singleton pattern. How to implement it and when and where it is useful to apply.

## What does it do?

1. The singleton pattern controls how many instances of a class can be created<d-footnote>To control access to shared resources, such as a database connection or a file.</d-footnote>

2. Provide a global access point to that instance<d-footnote>With simple global variable that store important content, this content may be overwritten almost by everything, however singleton allows the access, but it as well protects from overwriting it</d-footnote>

  * Imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, you’ll get the one you already created

  {% details note %}
  this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular constructor since a constructor call must always return a new object by design
  {% enddetails %} 


---

## Implementation

1. Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the `new` operator with the Singleton class.

2. Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.


 *  If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it’s able to call the Singleton’s static method. So whenever that method is called, the same object is always returned.

## Code example

```c#
// The Database class defines the `getInstance` method that lets
// clients access the same instance of a database connection
// throughout the program.
class Database is
    // The field for storing the singleton instance should be
    // declared static.
    private static field instance: Database

    // The singleton's constructor should always be private to
    // prevent direct construction calls with the `new`
    // operator.
    private constructor Database() is
        // Some initialization code, such as the actual
        // connection to a database server.
        // ...

    // The static method that controls access to the singleton
    // instance.
    public static method getInstance() is
        if (Database.instance == null) then
            acquireThreadLock() and then
                // Ensure that the instance hasn't yet been
                // initialized by another thread while this one
                // has been waiting for the lock's release.
                if (Database.instance == null) then
                    Database.instance = new Database()
        return Database.instance

    // Finally, any singleton should define some business logic
    // which can be executed on its instance.
    public method query(sql) is
        // For instance, all database queries of an app go
        // through this method. Therefore, you can place
        // throttling or caching logic here.
        // ...

class Application is
    method main() is
        Database foo = Database.getInstance()
        foo.query("SELECT ...")
        // ...
        Database bar = Database.getInstance()
        bar.query("SELECT ...")
        // The variable `bar` will contain the same object as
        // the variable `foo`.
```

## Pros and Cons of the Singleton Pattern

### **Pros**

- **Single Instance**: Ensures that a class has only one instance.
- **Global Access**: Provides a global access point to that instance.
- **Lazy Initialization**: The singleton object is only initialized when it's requested for the first time, saving resources.

### **Cons**

- **Violates Single Responsibility Principle**: The pattern solves two problems at once—controlling instance creation and providing global access.
- **Masks Bad Design**: Can hide design issues, as components may become overly dependent on each other.
- **Multithreading Issues**: In a multithreaded environment, special handling is required to avoid creating multiple singleton instances.
- **Difficult to Test**: Unit testing can be challenging because many frameworks rely on inheritance for mocking. The private constructor of a singleton makes mocking difficult, and static methods can’t be easily overridden in most languages.

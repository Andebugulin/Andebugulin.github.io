## Review

> The melodic and vibe of the song is great, the beat is fire, and the bars are top-notch. I really enjoyed the bars and the accent of central cee in this one. Dave had so many triples and doubles, it is hard to keep track of them all. Definitely one of the best songs ever made in terms of bars and flow.

## Bars
Best bars from the song that I think people missed:

> This ain't stainless steel, it's platinum <br> Dinner table, I got manners, huh <br><br> I believe stainless steel is a reference to the cutlery, because it fit to the context of the coming bars.

> Man have to send her therapy, she got the E-cup bra, a lot on her chest <br><br> this might be interpreted not only as get off her chest, and big bra size physically, but as well E-cup might be a reference to ecology cup, meaning it was made from recycled materials, which means it contains a lot, therefore a lot on her chest.

## Interesting thought
  >> It doesn't make sense to be depressed or sad about something you don't have, because if you do something in order to get it, rather than being sad, you have more chances to get it. If you don't do anything, and be sad, you will never get it.

  - I didn't study finnish vocab

### One micro-fix for tomorrow.
  - I will leave my phone in another room when I go to sleep

### Today’s energy level (1–10): `4`

## Interesting thought
  >> If I struggle to do activity that I need to do, it's easier to accomplish if I quickly imagine myself after I have accomplished it. For example, during finnish vocab, I everynow and then stuggle to be focused and motivated, but if I quickly imagine myself feeling good after I have finished today finnish vocab, I get more motivated to do it. And I stop day dreaming and crying about how hard it is to do it.

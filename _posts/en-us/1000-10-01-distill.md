-     Interesting thought:
  - It doesn't make sense to be depressed or sad about something you don't have, because if you do
  something in order to get it, rather than being sad, you have more chances to get it. If you don't do anything, and be sad,
  you will never get it.

-     What I did right.
  - I cleaned my workspace and room
  - I exercised in the bgym (basketball)

-     What annoyed me.
  - I scrolled when I woke up
  - I was angry that I couldn't find motivation to study
  - I couldn't keep being focused on my tasks in the studying room and talked with friends
  - I didn't study finnish vocab

-     One micro-fix for tomorrow.
  - I will leave my phone in another room when I go to sleep
